Was just thinking about you
I wish there was an edible arrangement that was worthy of you
Was just wondering what you were up to
Can we FaceTime later? Missin’ you
Miss you baby
Was just wondering how your day was going
Thinking about how good looking you are
How’s your day babe?
I miss you
Can I see you?
I want to hear all about your day
Wish I could be there with you
I bet you look great today
Let’s do something fun
Netflix &amp; chill?
Amazon prime &amp; commitment?
I’m so lucky
😍
😘
❤️
TV &amp; takeout?
“Your Song” by Elton John reminds me of you
Is there a movie out you’d like to see?
Gonna call to say hi in a few
Hey good lookin’
😍 - me thinking about you
I look like an idiot smiling in public whenever you text me
Bae ❤️
*thinking about your eyes*
You're my favorite human ☺️
*thinking about your eyes* 😍😍
You're my favorite human
I like how weird you are
I want to take you out
"A Matter of Trust" by Billy Joel made me think of you
Wish I was skilled enough to write you a song
You're like a human chocolate chip cookie
We should get a puppy. Is that weird?
You make it hard to focus
Brb making you a Spotify playlist
You're the best
Wish we could just nap
Here's looking at you, kid.
Is it time to go home and watch a movie yet?
Wanna work on our night cheese?
HIIIIIIII
Don't make any plans next weekend
I want pizza (and you)
I found a recipe I want to try to make us
Thinking we could name our future puppy Alfredo
Game night? Maybe you can let me win this time? ;)
Got you something (and no I'm not telling you what it is)
If you're a bird, I'm a bird ;)
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die
Nobody puts baby in a corner, right?
You make me almost as happy as Leo finally winning an Oscar
You're the best picture of my heart
We'd be such a power couple on that red carpet
I bet I'd win Best Original Screenplay if I wrote about you
You make me happier than a perfect Oscar ballot
