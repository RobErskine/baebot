Was just thinking about you
I wish there was an edible arrangement that was worthy of you
Was just wondering what you were up to
Can we FaceTime later? Missin’ you
Miss you bby
Was just wondering how your day was going
Thinking about how good looking you are
How’s your day babe?
I miss you
Can I see you?
I want to hear all about your day
Wish I could be there with you
I bet you look great today
Let’s do something fun
Netflix &amp; chill?
Amazon prime &amp; commitment?
I’m so lucky
😍
😘
❤️
TV &amp; takeout?
“Your Song” - Elton John reminds me of you
Is there a movie out you’d like to see?
Gonna call to say hi in a few
Hey good lookin’
😍 - me thinking about you
I look like an idiot smiling in public whenever you text me
Bae ❤️
*thinking about your eyes*
You're my favorite human
I like how weird you are
I want to take you out
"A Matter of Trust" by Billy Joel made me think of you
Wish I was skilled enough to write you a song
You're like a human chocolate chip cookie
We should get a puppy?
You make it hard to focus
Brb making you a Spotify playlist
You're the best
Wish we could just nap
